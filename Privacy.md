# Privacy Policy for V(U)iew(TC) GHv2.6

*Last updated: March 08, 2025*

## Introduction
V(U)iew(TC) is a lightweight dashboard designed for amateur radio enthusiasts to monitor HF propagation conditions using publicly available solar and geomagnetic data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.

## Data We Collect
V(U)iew(TC) is designed to minimize data collection and does not store personal information by default. The only potential personal data involved is:

- **Callsigns in QRZ Search:** When you use the QRZ search feature by entering a callsign (e.g., "LB6QJ") and clicking "Search," the callsign is sent directly to QRZ.com to perform a lookup. We do not store or process this callsign locally.

No other personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, or IP addresses) is collected or stored by V(U)iew(TC).

## How We Use Your Data
- **Purpose:** The callsign you enter in the QRZ search field is used solely to redirect you to the QRZ.com database for lookup purposes.
- **Legal Basis:** By entering a callsign and initiating the search, you provide your consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a)) for this data to be sent to QRZ.com.
- **No Local Processing:** V(U)iew(TC) does not store, analyze, or otherwise process the callsign beyond facilitating the redirect.

## Third-Party Data Sharing
- **QRZ.com:** When you use the QRZ search feature, the callsign is sent to QRZ.com, a third-party service. QRZ.com operates as an independent data controller and has its own privacy policy. We recommend reviewing [QRZ.com's Privacy Policy](https://www.qrz.com/page/privacy.html) to understand how they handle your data.
- **No Other Sharing:** V(U)iew(TC) does not share your data with any other third parties.

## Data Storage and Security
- V(U)iew(TC) does not store any personal data locally. The callsign you enter is processed momentarily in your browser and sent securely via HTTPS to QRZ.com. No logs or records of your input are kept by this application.

## Your Rights
Under GDPR, you have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to the processing of your personal data. Since V(U)iew(TC) does not store your data:
- Any exercise of these rights related to QRZ search data must be directed to QRZ.com.
- For questions about V(U)iew(TC), see the contact section below.

## Updates and Version Checking
V(U)iew(TC) checks for updates daily by querying GitHub's public API (`https://api.github.com/repos/rSignal86/ViewUTC/releases/latest`). This process does not involve any personal data â€“ it only retrieves release information to notify you of new versions.
